# Encrypted ERC-20 Protocol

The Encrypted ERC-20 (eERC) is a protocol that enables efficient confidential token transfers on Avalanche blockchain. eERC does not require modification at the protocol level or off-chain actors and relies purely on zk-SNARKs and homomorphic encryption. It comes with various features such as:

-   Confidential Transactions: Conceals the token balances of users and the amounts in each transaction.
-   Supports large integers: Allows for the use of integers up to 2^128 bits.
-   Client-side operations: Encryption, decryption and proof generation are conducted by the users from client side.
-   Fully on-chain Nature: Operates entirely on-chain without the need for relayers or off-chain actors.
-   Native compliance: Auditors can audit the transaction details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need following dependencies for setup:

-   `NodeJS >= v16.x `
-   `Golang >= 1.20.x `

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/EncryptedERC.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    Note: This command will run a bash script to compile gnark's circuits, if this does not work:
    In [zk](#zk) directory run the following command to build manually:

    On x64:

    ```sh
    go build -o ../outputs/eerc20_zk_x64
    ```

    On arm64:

    ```sh
    go build -o ../outputs/eerc20_zk
    ```

### Run Tests/Coverage

Contract tests:

```
npx hardhat coverage
```

Jest:

```
npm run test --coverage
```
