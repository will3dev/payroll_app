# Encrypted ERC-20 Protocol

The Encrypted ERC-20 (eERC) standard enables secure and confidential token transfers on Avalanche blockchains. Leveraging zk-SNARKs and partially homomorphic encryption, the eERC protocol offers robust privacy without requiring protocol-level modifications or off-chain intermediaries.
AvaCloud API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.avacloud.io/encrypted-erc/getting-started/what-is-encrypted-erc)

## Key features

- **Confidential Transactions**: User balances and transaction amounts remain completely hidden, ensuring financial privacy.

- **Large Integers**: Efficiently handles large token amounts up to 128 bits (2^128), accommodating substantial financial transactions.

- **Client-Side Operations**: Users retain control, performing encryption, decryption, and zk-proof generation directly on their own devices.

- **Fully On-chain Nature**: Operates entirely on-chain without the need for relayers or off-chain actors.

- **Built-in Compliance**: Supports external auditors, ensuring regulatory compliance.

- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Supports both standalone tokens and conversion of existing ERC-20 tokens.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Uses zk-SNARKs to validate transactions without revealing sensitive information.

- **Chain Agnostic**: Can be deployed on any EVM-compatible blockchains.

## Architecture

The eERC protocol consists of several key components:

### Core Contracts

- **EncryptedERC** ([contracts/EncryptedERC.sol](contracts/EncryptedERC.sol)): The main contract that implements the privacy-preserving ERC-20 functionality. It handles:

  - Private token operations (mint, burn, transfer)
  - Privacy-preserving balance management
  - Integration with other core components

- **Registrar**: Manages user registration and public key association.

  - Handles user registration
  - Stores public keys
  - Validates user identities
  - Manages registration proofs

- **EncryptedUserBalances**: Handles encrypted balance storage and updates.

  - Stores encrypted balances
  - Manages balance updates in encrypted manner
  - Ensures balance privacy
  - Handles encrypted balance verification

- **TokenTracker**: Manages token registration and tracking.

  - Tracks registered tokens
  - Manages token metadata
  - Handles token blacklisting

- **AuditorManager**: Provides auditor-related functionality for compliance.
  - Manages auditor permissions
  - Stores auditor address with it's public key

### Cryptographic Components

- **BabyJubJub**: Library for elliptic curve operations on the BabyJubJub curve.

- **Zero-Knowledge Circuits**: Circom-based circuits for proof generation and verification.

  - **Registration Circuit**: Validates user registration
  - **Mint Circuit**: Verifies minting operations
  - **Transfer Circuit**: Validates private transfers
  - **Withdraw Circuit**: Verifies withdrawal operations

### Operation Modes

1. **Standalone Mode**:

   - Creates entirely new private ERC-20 tokens
   - Built-in privacy features
   - Direct token operations

2. **Converter Mode**:
   - Adds privacy features to existing ERC-20 tokens
   - Wraps existing ERC20 tokens
   - Enables privacy through deposit/withdraw
   - Maintains compatibility with original tokens

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need following dependencies for setup:

- `NodeJS >= v22.x`

- `Circom >= 2.1.9`

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/EncryptedERC.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Compile the contracts

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Compile Circuits

```sh
npx hardhat zkit make --force # compiles circuits
npx hardhat zkit verifiers    # generates verifiers
```

## Deployment (Local)

### Standalone

The Standalone version lets users create entirely new private ERC-20 tokens with built-in privacy, supporting confidential minting and burning.

1. Start the local node

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

2. Deploy the contract

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-standalone.ts --network localhost
```

Refer to the [scripts/deploy-standalone.ts](scripts/deploy-standalone.ts) script for deployment examples.

### Converter

The Converter version adds privacy features to existing ERC-20 tokens, enabling users to convert standard ERC-20 tokens to private ones and switch between public and private states through deposit and withdrawal functions.

1. Start the local node

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

2. Deploy the contract

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-converter.ts --network localhost
```

Refer to the [scripts/deploy-converter.ts](scripts/deploy-converter.ts) script for deployment examples.

## Security Audits

1. **Circom Audit**

   - Date: March 2025
   - Scope: Circom circuits for various zero-knowledge proofs
   - Report: [avacloud-eerc-circom-audit.pdf](audit/avacloud-eerc-circom-audit.pdf)

2. **Gnark Audit**
   - Date: March 2025
   - Scope: Core protocol and Gnark circuits for zero-knowledge proofs
   - Report: [avacloud-eerc-audit.pdf](audit/avacloud-eerc-audit.pdf)

## Security Considerations

- **Auditor Integration**: The protocol includes built-in auditor functionality for compliance.

- **Blacklisting**: Supports optionalblacklisting for security purposes.

### Notes

For production deployments, set `isProd` to `true` in the deployment scripts to use the production verifiers. These verifiers use secure trusted setups from the [zkevm](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs?tab=readme-ov-file#7-prepare-phase-2).

Corresponding `zkey` and `verification_key.json` files are present in the `circuits/build` directory. After compiling circuits present in the `circuits` folder, and downloading the proper `.ptau` files, these can be verified using the `snarkjs` tool with the following command:

```sh
snarkjs zkey verify <circuit_name>.r1cs powersOfTau28_hez_final_<Size>.ptau <circuit_name>.zkey
```

- For transfer/mint circuit => `powersOfTau28_hez_final_15.ptau`
- For withdraw circuit => `powersOfTau28_hez_final_14.ptau`
- For registration circuit => `powersOfTau28_hez_final_11.ptau`
